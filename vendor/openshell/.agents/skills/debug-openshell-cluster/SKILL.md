# Debug OpenShell Gateway Deployment

Diagnose a gateway and its selected compute platform. Do not assume OpenShell provisions Kubernetes or runs a k3s container. OpenShell targets a reachable gateway endpoint backed by Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, or the experimental VM driver.

Use `openshell` first to identify the active endpoint. Then use the platform tools that match the gateway's compute driver: `docker`, `podman`, `kubectl`/`helm`, or VM driver logs.

## Overview

The target deployment flow is:

1. Operator starts or deploys the gateway.
2. Operator configures the compute driver.
3. Operator provides TLS and SSH relay material for the deployment mode.
4. The CLI registers a reachable gateway endpoint with `openshell gateway add`.
5. The gateway creates sandboxes through the selected compute driver.

For local evaluation only, TLS may be disabled and the gateway can be reached through `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.

## Prerequisites

- The `openshell` CLI must be available for endpoint checks.
- Know the active gateway name and endpoint, or be able to inspect local gateway metadata.
- Know the compute platform: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, or VM.
- For Kubernetes: `kubectl` must target the cluster that hosts OpenShell and Helm version 3 or later must be available.
- For Docker or Podman: the runtime socket must be reachable from the gateway host.

## Workflow

Run diagnostics in order and stop once the root cause is clear.

### Step 1: Check CLI Reachability

```bash
openshell gateway info
openshell status
```

Common findings:

- `No active gateway`: register one with `openshell gateway add <endpoint>`.
- Connection refused: gateway process is not running, service exposure is wrong, or a port-forward/proxy is not active.
- TLS/certificate errors: CLI mTLS bundle does not match the gateway CA, or the gateway is running with unexpected TLS settings.

### Step 2: Identify the Compute Platform

Use gateway metadata, deployment values, or the user's setup notes to identify the driver.

| Platform | Primary checks |
|---|---|
| Docker | Gateway process logs, Docker daemon health, sandbox containers, image pulls. |
| Podman | Podman socket, rootless networking, sandbox containers, image pulls. |
| Kubernetes | Helm release, StatefulSet, service, secrets, sandbox pods, events. |
| VM | VM driver logs, rootfs availability, host virtualization support. |

### Step 3: Check Docker-Backed Gateways

```bash
docker info
docker ps --filter name=openshell
docker logs <container> --tail=200
openshell status
```

Common findings:

- Docker daemon unavailable: start Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.
- Gateway process stopped: inspect exit status and logs.
- Sandbox image missing or pull denied: verify image reference and registry credentials.
- Sandbox never registers: check gateway logs and supervisor callback endpoint.

For source checkout development, restart the local gateway with:

```bash
mise run gateway:docker
```

### Step 4: Check Podman-Backed Gateways

```bash
podman info
podman ps --filter name=openshell
podman logs <container> --tail=200
openshell status
```

Common findings:

- Podman socket unavailable: start or expose the user socket.
- Rootless networking unavailable: inspect Podman network configuration.
- Sandbox image missing or pull denied: verify image reference and registry credentials.
- Supervisor cannot call back: check callback endpoint and gateway logs.

### Step 5: Check Kubernetes Helm Gateways

```bash
helm -n openshell status openshell
helm -n openshell get values openshell
kubectl -n openshell get statefulset,pod,svc,pvc
kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell --tail=200
kubectl -n openshell rollout status statefulset/openshell
```

Look for failed installs, unexpected values, missing namespace, wrong image tag, TLS settings that do not match the registered endpoint, and scheduling failures.

Check required Helm deployment secrets:

```bash
kubectl -n openshell get secret \
  openshell-ssh-handshake \
  openshell-server-tls \
  openshell-server-client-ca \
  openshell-client-tls
```

Check the image references currently used by the gateway deployment:

```bash
kubectl -n openshell get statefulset openshell -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].image}{\"\n\"}{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].env[?(@.name==\"OPENSHELL_SUPERVISOR_IMAGE\")].value}{\"\n\"}"
helm -n openshell get values openshell | grep -E 'repository|tag|supervisorImage'
```

The gateway image and `server.supervisorImage` should use the same build tag in branch and E2E deploys. A stale supervisor image can make sandbox behavior lag behind gateway policy or proto changes.

For plaintext local evaluation, confirm the chart has:

```bash
helm -n openshell get values openshell | grep -E 'disableTls|grpcEndpoint'
```

Expected shape:

```yaml
server:
  disableTls: true
  grpcEndpoint: http://openshell.openshell.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

Check service exposure:

```bash
kubectl -n openshell get svc openshell -o wide
kubectl -n openshell get endpoints openshell
```

For local port-forward testing:

```bash
kubectl -n openshell port-forward svc/openshell 8080:8080
openshell gateway add http://127.0.0.1:8080 --local --name local
openshell status
```

If the gateway is healthy but sandbox creation fails:

```bash
kubectl -n openshell get pods
kubectl -n openshell get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -n 50
kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell --tail=200
```

Check the configured sandbox namespace:

```bash
helm -n openshell get values openshell | grep sandboxNamespace
```

Then inspect sandbox resources in that namespace.

### Step 6: Check VM-Backed Gateways

Use the VM driver logs and host diagnostics available in the user's environment. Verify:

- The VM driver process is running and reachable by the gateway.
- The runtime rootfs exists and matches the expected architecture.
- Host virtualization support is enabled.
- The sandbox supervisor can establish its callback connection to the gateway.

Then run:

```bash
openshell status
openshell logs <sandbox-name>
```

## Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `openshell status` fails | Gateway endpoint unreachable or auth mismatch | `openshell gateway info`, gateway logs |
| Gateway starts but sandbox create fails | Compute driver cannot reach runtime | Docker/Podman/Kubernetes/VM driver logs |
| Docker or Podman sandbox never registers | Wrong callback endpoint or supervisor startup failure | Gateway logs and sandbox container logs |
| Kubernetes gateway pod pending | PVC unbound, taint, selector, or insufficient resources | `kubectl -n openshell describe pod <pod>` |
| Kubernetes gateway pod crash loops | Missing secret, bad DB URL, bad TLS config | `kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell` |
| CLI TLS error | Local mTLS bundle does not match server cert/CA | Check `~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/` |
| Image pull failure | Gateway or sandbox image cannot be pulled | Runtime events and image pull credentials |
| `K8s namespace not ready` with `envoy-gateway-openshell.yaml: the server could not find the requested resource` | Optional Gateway API manifest was auto-applied without Envoy Gateway CRDs, or k3s Helm controller startup exceeded the namespace wait | Confirm the cluster image only bundles core manifests; apply `deploy/kube/manifests/envoy-gateway-openshell.yaml` manually only when `grpcRoute` is enabled |

## Reporting

When handing results back to the user, include:

- Active gateway endpoint and auth mode.
- Compute platform and driver.
- Gateway process or workload status.
- Recent gateway log summary.
- Missing or malformed TLS or SSH relay material.
- Service exposure status.
- Sandbox workload status.
- The exact command that failed and the shortest fix.
